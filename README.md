# Sip and Play Website (2024 Codédex Hackathon)
Welcome to the Sip & Play website repository! This project is an interactive web platform designed to showcase the unique offerings of Sip & Play, a board game cafe. Our team, consisting of enthusiastic beginners, embarked on this journey to create an inviting and user-friendly website that reflects the vibrant atmosphere of our cafe.

## Description
Sip & Play is more than just a cafe; it's a community hub where people can gather to enjoy delicious drinks and play a variety of board games. This website aims to provide visitors with all the information they need about our menu, events, and game collection.

## Our Journey
Our team is composed entirely of beginners in web development. While my team focused on the design aspects, bringing their creative vision to life, I took on the challenge of building the website from the ground up. This project has been a significant learning experience for all of us, and we are proud to share the result of our hard work.
